<span class="title">Types of Information We Collect</span>
<p>
This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on our web sites. There are two categories of information: Anonymous and Personally Identifiable.</p>
<p>
Anonymous Information is information that cannot be tied to an identifiable customer. Examples include general web site traffic information such as total number of customers visiting our site, or suggestion box submissions where submitting information is optional.</p>
<p>
Personally Identifiable Information is information that tells us specifics about you, such as name, email and zip code. We use this to deliver personalized information to you. An example is the Notify Me! Feature on <a href="http://www.sheahomes.com" target="_blank">www.sheahomes.com</a>, which keeps customers informed about upcoming communities.</p>
