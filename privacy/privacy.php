Our approach to managing information from our website is always &quot;customer 
privacy first&quot;. This means when we have a decision to make about how 
to use information from our websites, it must pass an internal test&#133;. 
Is the customer's privacy compromised in any way? If the answer is yes, we 
don't do it.</p>
