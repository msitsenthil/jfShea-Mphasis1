A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive that contains information about the user. Our websites use cookies. When a customer fills out a form on our site, such as when registering for Home Owner Services or signing up for Notify Me! The contents of the form is saved in a cookie on their hard drive. The next time the customer needs information, such as when submitting a customer service request, or requesting Notify Me! on another community, the information is automatically populated for them from the cookie. We never link cookies to personally identifiable information. Our use of cookies is specific to storing registration/form information so the user will not have to enter it more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site such as the Home Owner Services section on www.sheahomes.com, which uses the information stored in the cookie to submit to a ccustomer service request.</p>
