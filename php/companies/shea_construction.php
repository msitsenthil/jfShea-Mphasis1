					<p>The history of the Shea family of companies began modestly enough in 1881 when company founder John F. Shea established a small plumbing business in Portland, Oregon.  From those humble beginnings, his sons and their sons after them built the J.F. Shea Company into one of the largest privately held <a href="http://www.sheahomes.com">home builders</a> in the nation.</p> 
					<p>At the core of this family network of influential companies is J.F. Shea Construction, Inc. - one of today's largest and most respected civil contractors in the nation.  The construction company's legacy of milestone achievements include the building of the Golden Gate Bridge, Hoover Dam, and San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system.</p>
